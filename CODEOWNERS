# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @ucalgary-ilab/ucalgary-ilab-website will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
* @ucalgary-ilab/ucalgary-ilab-website

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. 

# When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies ,github files, only @ucalgary-ilab/ucalgary-ilab-devops and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
.github/ @ucalgary-ilab/ucalgary-ilab-devops
