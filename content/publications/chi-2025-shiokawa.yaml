abstract: "We are increasingly adopting domestic robots (e.g., Roomba) that provide relief from mundane household tasks. However, these robots usually only spend little time executing their specific task and remain idle for long periods. They typically possess advanced mobility and sensing capabilities, and therefore have significant potential applications beyond their designed use. Our work explores this untapped potential of domestic robots in ubiquitous computing, focusing on how they can improve and support modern lifestyles. We conducted two studies: an online survey (n=50) to understand current usage patterns of these robots within homes and an exploratory study (n=12) with HCI and HRI experts. Our thematic analysis revealed 12 key dimensions for developing interactions with domestic robots and outlined over 100 use cases, illustrating how these robots can offer proactive assistance and provide privacy. Finally, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of reappropriating domestic robots for diverse ubiquitous computing applications."
