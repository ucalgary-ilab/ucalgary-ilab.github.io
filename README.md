# How to Update the Website

## Generic Workflow for all updates

- [Create an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) to document you planned changes.
  - [Create a branch to work on the above issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-a-branch-for-an-issue) with a concise self-explanatory title describing your anticipated updates.
  - Browse your branch by following the hyperlink generated in your issue.
  - Update your branch files with desired changes: browse [Updating Specific Content](#updating-specific-content) for more details.
- [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) (optionally in draft mode if you need more updates) with a similar title as for your issue.
  - [Link your pull request to your issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) by referencing your issue in your pull request description.
  - Preview changes: continuous integration will deploy a preview for your changes, linked via a comment in your pull request (more details: https://github.com/rossjrw/pr-preview-action).
  - Followup with [pull request reviews](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews): reviewer invitations are automated based on mappings between files and [teams](https://github.com/orgs/ucalgary-ilab/teams) defined in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS).
  - Merge your pull request once approved.

## Updating Specific Content

### How to Update People

iLab members are each represented by a definition file `content/people/*.yaml`.

The required definition elements are `name` and `type` (plus `keywords` for `faculty`). Other fields are optional.

Membership `type` values include:

```yaml
- faculty
- phd
- master
- undergrad
- postdoc
- visiting
- alumni
```

When members leave iLab, please modify the `type` to `alumni`. Alumni files can specify `past` (previous `type` e.g., `phd`, `master`, etc) and `now` (current institution as string).

#### How to add a new member

1. Find an existing example that best matches your membership `type`, for instance you can start we these suggestions:
   - `faculty`: [content/people/ryo-suzuki.yaml](content/people/ryo-suzuki.yaml)
   - `phd`: [content/people/kathryn-blair.yaml](content/people/kathryn-blair.yaml)
   - `master`: [content/people/clara-xi.yaml](content/people/clara-xi.yaml)
   - `undergrad`: [content/people/lychelle-pham.yaml](content/people/lychelle-pham.yaml)
   - `postdoc`: [content/people/soren-knudsen.yaml](content/people/soren-knudsen.yaml)
   - `visiting`: [content/people/nathalie-bressa.yaml](content/people/nathalie-bressa.yaml)
   - `alumni`: [content/people/bon-adriel-aseniero.yaml](content/people/bon-adriel-aseniero.yaml)

2. Browse (online) or checkout (local) your new branch created following [Generic Workflow for all updates](#generic-workflow-for-all-updates) and navigate under `content/people`

3. To Add: Click `Add file` > `Create new File`. To Modify: Click `Edit this file` (online) or git add it (local)

4. **Type file name as `first-last.yaml`**. For example, `ryo-suzuki.yaml`

5. Save and commit the new file

#### How to add/modify a profile picture

1. Browse (online) or checkout (local) your new branch created following [Generic Workflow for all updates](#generic-workflow-for-all-updates) and navigate under `static/images/people`

2. Prepare a profile image. **The image needs to be saved as `first-last.jpg`. (The same as the profile file name)**. For example, **`ryo-suzuki.jpg`**. Do not use `png` or `jpeg` or anything else. You don't need to crop or edit to the square shape. The system automatically does.

3. Click `Upload files` and upload it (online) or git add it (local)

4. Save and commit the new file

5. If you want to replace, delete the existing one and do the same process.

### How to Update Publications

#### How to add/modify a publication

1. Browse (online) or checkout (local) your new branch created following [Generic Workflow for all updates](#generic-workflow-for-all-updates) and navigate under `content/publications`

2. To Add: Click `Add file` > `Create new File`. To Modify: Click `Edit this file` (online) or git add it (local)

3. **Type file name as `conference-years-lastname.yaml`**. For example, `uist-2020-suzuki.yaml`, `mobilehci-2019-hung.yaml`, `chi-ea-2020-suzuki.yaml`

4. Edit the file. For example

Example 1 (`chi-2018-feick.yaml`)

```yaml
date: 2018-04
title: "Perspective on and Re-orientation of Physical Proxies in Object-Focused Remote Collaboration"
authors:
  - Martin Feick
  - Terrance Tin Hoi Mok
  - Anthony Tang
  - Lora Oehlberg
  - Ehud Sharlin
series: CHI 2018
doi: https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173855
keywords: cscw, remote collaboration, object-focused collaboration, physical telepresence, collaborative physical tasks
pages: 13
award: Honorable Mention
video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfxTHsPJWHY
abstract: "Remote collaborators working together on physical objects have difficulty building a shared understanding of what each person is talking about. Conventional video chat systems are insufficient for many situations because they present a single view of the object in a flattened image. To understand how this limited perspective affects collaboration, we designed the Remote Manipulator (ReMa), which can reproduce orientation manipulations on a proxy object at a remote site. We conducted two studies with ReMa, with two main findings. First, a shared perspective is more effective and preferred compared to the opposing perspective offered by conventional video chat systems. Second, the physical proxy and video chat complement one another in a combined system: people used the physical proxy to understand objects, and used video chat to perform gestures and confirm remote actions."
```


Example 2 (`tvcg-2019-walny.yaml`)

```yaml
date: 2019-08
title: "Data Changes Everything: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Design Handoff"
authors:
  - Jagoda Walny
  - Christian Frisson
  - Mieka West
  - Doris Kosminsky
  - SÃ¸ren Knudsen
  - Sheelagh Carpendale
  - Wesley Willett
series: TVCG 2019
doi: https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934538
keywords: information visualization, design handoff, data mapping, design process
pages: 10
video: https://vimeo.com/360483702
talk: https://vimeo.com/368703151
abstract: "Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design."

### How to add/modify a cover figure

1. Browse (online) or checkout (local) your new branch created following [Generic Workflow for all updates](#generic-workflow-for-all-updates) and navigate under `static/images/publications/cover`

2. Prepare a cover figure for the paper. **The image needs to be saved as `conference-year-lastname.jpg`. (The same as the publication file name).** For example, `uist-2020-suzuki.jpg`, `mobilehci-2019-hung.yaml`, `chi-ea-2020-suzuki.yaml`. Do not use `png` or `jpeg` or anything else. You don't need to crop or edit the aspect ratio. The system automatically does.

2. Click `Add file` > `Upload files` (online) or git add it (local)

4. Save and commit the new file

5. If you want to replace, delete the existing one and do the same process.

### How to add more figures

1. You can also add more figures by just drag-and-drop. (*Strongly recommended*).

2. Prepare figures you used for the paper.

3. Git clone

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ucalgary-ilab/ilab-website.git
```

4. Create a directory as `static/images/publications/figures/[conference-year-lastname]`. For example, `static/images/publications/figures/uist-2020-suzuki`

```shell
cd ilab-website
mkdir static/images/publications/figures/[conf-year-last]
```

5. Copy and paste all of the figures into the created folder. No need to modify at all. Both jpg, jpeg, png files are available.

6. Git add and git push

```shell
git add .
git commit -m 'Add more figures'
git push origin master
```

## Development

### How to Check by Running the Server in Local

You don't need to do this process, but if you're interested, here is the process.

Note: worked with Node v16, but got error with Node v18. (should be fixed in the future)

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ucalgary-ilab/ilab-website.git
cd ilab-website
npm install
npm run build:content
node preprocess.js
node server.js
```

You can also keep watching the file change by running the following command in the different terminal tab

```shell
npm run watch
```

Watch [https://youtu.be/ympcMWQHm1c](https://youtu.be/ympcMWQHm1c) for the video instruction.

### How to Deploy and Reflect the Change in the Website

Deployment is automated via continuous integration, as defined in [.github/workflows/deployment-gh-pages.yml](.github/workflows/deployment-gh-pages.yml), and via our [Generic Workflow for all updates](#generic-workflow-for-all-updates).

When continuous integration fails, here is a workaround to deploy from a local clone:

#### Clone

Create a second clone checked out at the `gh-pages` branch (needed once):

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ucalgary-ilab/ucalgary-ilab.github.io.git -b gh-pages ../gh-pages
```

#### Deploy

```shell
npm run deploy
```
