Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children\'s stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child\'s playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children\'s stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children\'s mental health.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"imwut-2020-wang.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"imwut-2020-wang.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["utouch"]}')},588:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2017-01","title":"Embedded Data Representations","authors":["Wesley Willett","Yvonne Jansen","Pierre Dragicevic"],"series":"TVCG 2017","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598608","keywords":"information visualization, data physicalization, ambient displays, ubiquitous computing, augmented reality","pages":10,"video":"https://vimeo.com/182971005","talk":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS7lU60xChI","abstract":"We introduce embedded data representations, the use of visual and physical representations of data that are deeply integrated with the physical spaces, objects, and entities to which the data refers.

Then, in the ’70s, personal computers \'moved in\' with users. In the ’90s, mobile devices moved computing into users’ pockets. More recently, wearable devices brought computing into constant physical contact with the user’s skin. These transitions proved useful: moving closer to users allowed interactive devices to sense more of their user and act more personal. The main question that drives my research is: what is the next interface paradigm that supersedes wearable devices? The primary way researchers have been investigating this is by asking where future interactive devices will be located with respect to the user’s body. Many posit that the next generation of interfaces will be implanted inside the user’s body. However, I argue that their location with respect to the user’s body is not the primary factor; in fact, implanted devices are already happening in that we have pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc. Instead, I argue that the key factor is how devices will integrate with the user’s biological senses and actuators. This body-device integration allowed us to engineer interactive devices that intentionally borrow parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body. For example, one such type of body-integrated devices, which I have advanced recently, are interactive systems based on electrical muscle stimulation. These devices move their user’s muscles using computer-controlled electrical impulses, achieving the functionality of robotic exoskeletons without the bulky motors. The key insight is that engineering devices that intentionally borrow parts of the user’s biology puts forward a new generation of miniaturized devices; allowing us to circumvent traditional physical constraints. For instance, in the case of our devices based on electrical muscle stimulation, they demonstrate how our body-device integration circumvents the constraints imposed by the ratio of electrical power and size of a motor (i.e., the stronger/larger a motor is, the more current needed to actuate it). Taking this further, we demonstrate how our body-device integration approach allowed us to also miniaturize thermal feedback (hot/cold sensations) without the need for power-hungry devices like Peltiers, air conditioners, or heaters. We believe that these bodily-integrated devices are the natural succession to wearable interfaces and allow us to investigate how interfaces might connect to our bodies in a more direct and personal way.","bio":"Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

However, 3D-printed objects are typically static with limited or no moving parts. Creating 3D printable objects with kinetic behaviors such as deformation and motion is inherently challenging. To enrich the literature for making movable 3D-printed parts and support a wider spectrum of applications, I introduce the concept of “print driver”, a class of parametric mechanisms that use uniquely designed mechanical elements and are printed in place to augment 3D-printed objects with the ability of deformation, actuation, and sensing. In this talk, I will present a series of my research works to showcase how the print drivers can be used to lower the barrier for making 3D-printed kinetic objects and to support augmented 3D printable behaviors for interactivity. I will also share my personal thoughts on how to incorporate print drivers into objects, the human body, and space for good.","bio":"Liang He is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Jon E.

What holds widely adopted use back is the limited ability to modify and fabricate existing models. It may seem like a portable format already exist, as laser cut models are already widely shared in the form of 2D cutting plans. However, such files are susceptible to variations in cutter properties (aka kerf) and do not allow modifying the model in any meaningful way. I consider this format machine specific. In computing, this problem was solved in the 50s by developing compilers. This allowed developers to abstract away from the hardware and as a result, write code that remained relevant to this day. The resulting code is portable, e.g. it can be transferred from one machine to another. This transition has revolutionized not only computing but also all fields that use digital formats like desktop publishing, digital video, digital audio, etc. I believe that by transitioning towards a portable format for laser cutting we can make a similar transition from 1000s of users and one-off models towards millions of users and advanced models developed by multiple creators. My first take on the challenge is to see how far we get by building on the de-facto standard, i.e., 2D cutting plans. I wrote software tools to modify 2D cutting plans, replacing non-portable elements with portable counterparts. This makes the models portable, but it is still hard to modify them. I thus take a more radical approach, which is to move to a 3D exchange format (kyub). This guarantees portability by generating a new machine-specific 2D cutting plan for the local machine when exported. And the models inherently allow for parametric modifications. Instead, it raises the question of compatibility: Files already exist in 2D—how to get them into 3D? I demonstrate a software tool, assembler3, to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the model encoded in a 2D cutting plan, allows modifying it using a 3D editor, and re-encodes it to a 2D cutting plan. I demonstrate how this approach allows me to make a much wider range of modifications, including scaling, changing material thickness, and even remixing models.","bio":"Thijs Roumen is a PhD candidate in Human Computer Interaction in the lab of Patrick Baudisch, Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.

Mismatches in perception, understanding and action between road users can easily cause accidents. We are exploring how drivers implicitly communicate and coordinate with others on the road, and to assess how these driving interactions differ across cultures. By staging situations that demand negotiation, such as ambiguous four-way stops, we can capture how participants communicate with other drivers or pedestrians to coordinate joint action, implicitly through the movements of their virtual car or bodily movement, or explicitly through verbal or gestural exchange. By comparing how people from different cultures coordinate in comparable situations, we can better understand cultural differences in driving interaction.","bio":"Wendy Ju is an Associate Professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech and the Technion and in the Information Science field at Cornell University.

Designers often need to embed custom circuitry; program its workings; and create a form factor that not only reflects the desired user experience but can also house the required circuitry and electronics. To mitigate this, we created Pineal, a design tool that lets end-users: (1) modify 3D models to include a smart watch or phone as its heart; (2) specify high-level interactive behaviours through visual programming; and (3) have the phone or watch act out such behaviours as the objects\' \\"smarts\\".

Our contributions stem from a set of situated ideation workshops, an e-paper visualization workshop, the development of I/O Bits, and a prototype deployment where participants constructed their own I/O Bits and used them to track a range of personal data. We make three contributions with this work. First, we report on methodologies from seven design workshops that used ideation and sketching activities to prototype new situated visualizations. Based on our diverse set of workshops, we identify challenges and opportunities for sketching and ideating situated visualizations and highlight promising methods for both designers and researchers. Second, we use our design workshop results to design our novel situated self-tracking system, I/O Bits. We discuss the tensions experienced during our iterative design and development process and explore the design space of small situated visualizations on e-paper displays. Finally, we examine our findings from the situated ideation workshops, e-paper visualization workshop, development process, and prototype deployment. Using sketches, photos, hardware, audio recordings, and transcripts, we distill a set of insights and opportunities for future research on situated self-tracking.","dir":"content/output/theses","base":"msc-2021-wannamaker.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"msc-2021-wannamaker.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience"]}')},3113:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2020-01","title":"Construction and Performance Applications of an Augmented Violin: TRAVIS II","authors":["Chantelle Ko","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"CMJ 2020","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1162/comj_a_00563","pages":14,"abstract":"We present the second iteration of a Touch-Responsive Augmented Violin Interface System, called TRAVIS II, and two compositions that demonstrate its expressivity. TRAVIS II is an augmented acoustic violin with touch sensors integrated into its 3-D printed fingerboard that track left-hand finger gestures in real time. The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament that produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. Although these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four sensors attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. Although the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin. Our design allows violinists to naturally create music for interactive performance and improvisation without requiring new instrumental techniques. The first author composed two compositions to highlight TRAVIS II: “Dream State” and “Kindred Dichotomy.” Both of these compositions involve improvisation in their creative process and include interactive visuals. In this article we describe the design of the instrument, experiments leading to the sensing fingerboard, performative applications of the instrument, and compositional considerations for the resultant pieces.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"cmj-2020-ko.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"cmj-2020-ko.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},3167:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2019-06","title":"Mannequette: Understanding and Enabling Collaboration and Creativity on Avant-Garde Fashion-Tech Runways","authors":["Teddy Seyed","Anthony Tang"],"series":"DIS 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3322276.3322305","keywords":"fashion, haute couture, e-textiles, maker culture, fashion-tech, wearables, avant-garde, haute-tech couture, modular","award":"Honorable Mention","pages":13,"abstract":"Drawing upon multiple disciplines, avant-garde fashion-tech teams push the boundaries between fashion and technology.

Modern computing technologies, such as smartphones, offer convenient and swift access to information, facilitating tasks like reading documents or communicating with friends. However, these tools frequently lack adaptability, become distracting, consume excessive time, and impede interactions with people and contextual information. Furthermore, they often require numerous steps and significant time investment to gather pertinent information. We want to explore an efficient process of contextual information gathering for mixed reality (MR) interfaces that provide information directly in the user’s view. This approach allows for a seamless and flexible transition between language and subsequent contextual references, without disrupting the flow of communication. ’Augmented Language’ can be defined as the integration of language and communication with mixed reality to enhance, transform, or manipulate language-related aspects and various forms of linguistic augmentations (such as annotation/referencing, aiding social interactions, translation, localization, etc.). In this thesis, our broad objective is to explore mixed reality interfaces and their potential to enhance augmented language, particularly in the domains of speech and text. Our aim is to create interfaces that offer a more natural, generalizable, on-demand, and real-time experience of accessing contextually relevant information and providing adaptive interactions. To better address this broader objective, we systematically break it down to focus on two instances of augmented language. First, enhancing augmented conversation to support on-the-fly, co-located in-person conversations using embedded references. And second, enhancing digital and physical documents using MR to provide on-demand reading support in the form of different summarization techniques. To examine the effectiveness of these speech and text interfaces, we conducted two studies in which we asked the participants to evaluate our system prototype in different use cases. The exploratory usability study for the first exploration confirms that our system decreases distraction and friction in conversation compared to smartphone search while providing highly useful and relevant information. For the second project, we conducted an exploratory design workshop to identify categories of document enhancements. We later conducted a user study with a mixed-reality prototype to highlight five board themes to discuss the benefits of MR document enhancement.","dir":"content/output/theses","base":"msc-2023-jadon.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"msc-2023-jadon.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience"]}')},3274:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2021-05","title":"Homecoming: Exploring Returns to Long-Term Single Player Games","authors":["Noor Hammad","Owen Brierley","Zachary McKendrick","Sowmya Somanath","Patrick Finn","Jessica Hammer","Ehud Sharlin"],"series":"CHI 2021","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445357","keywords":"long-term single player game, autobiographical design, pivot point","pages":13,"video":null,"abstract":"We present an autobiographical design journey exploring the experience of returning to long-term single player games.

Anthropographics are visualizations that often use generic human-shaped symbols as abstract representations of humans. These visualizations are frequently used to convey the human importance of data related to people’s experiences, usually focusing on demographic data such as age, gender, race among others. However, most current anthropographics employ generic human shapes to represent data about distinct demographic groups, which can hide important demographic and physical differences between these groups. The use of generic human shapes in current anthropographics highlights the lack of inclusive approaches for representing human physical diversity in data visualizations. In response,we explore the creation of demographically diverse anthropographics that communicate the visible physical diversity of demographically-distinct populations.

Our work on Mutation suggests that classic performing art practices can be useful in cyborg transitioning, as well as in other technology augmented experiences.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"cnc-2019-hammad.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"cnc-2019-hammad.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["utouch"]}')},4492:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2020-07","title":"Touch Responsive Augmented Violin Interface System II: Integrating Sensors into a 3D Printed Fingerboard","authors":["Chantelle Ko","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"NIME 2020","keywords":"violin, touch sensor, FSR, fingerboard, augmented, 3D printing, conductive filament, interactive","talk":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INmDzkcIO14","pages":13,"abstract":"We present TRAVIS II, an augmented acoustic violin with touch sensors integrated into its 3D printed fingerboard that track left-hand finger gestures in real time.

The performer can also trigger presets via four FSRs attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. While the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin.

For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tvcg-2019-walny.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tvcg-2019-walny.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience","shivers"]}')},4536:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2021-06","title":"Participatory Art for Public Exploration of Algorithmic Decision-Making","authors":["Kathryn Blair","Pil Hansen","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"DIS 2021","doi":"10.1145/3461778.3462068","keywords":"Fine Arts, Physical Artifact, Education, Social Impact of Technology, Education, Participatory Art Installation","pages":4,"abstract":"Machine learning and predictive algorithms find patterns in large stores of data and make predictions which corporations and governments use to support decision-making.

Using an elicitation study, we asked participants to generate gestures in response to holographic task referents, where we varied the scale of holograms from desktop-scale to room-scale objects. We found that the scale of objects and scenes in the AR experience moderates the generated gestures. Most gestures were informed by physical interaction, and when people interacted from a distance, they sought a good perspective on the target object before and during the interaction.

The results of our user study and expert interviews confirm that our approach can lower the barrier to creating functional AR prototypes while also allowing flexible and general-purpose prototyping experiences.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2023-monteiro.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2023-monteiro.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience","programmable-reality"]}')},6311:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2019-06","title":"Astral: Prototyping Mobile and Smart Object Interactive Behaviours Using Familiar Applications","authors":["David Ledo","Jo Vermeulen","Sheelagh Carpendale","Saul Greenberg","Lora Oehlberg","Sebastian Boring"],"series":"DIS 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3322276.3322329","keywords":"smart objects, mobile interfaces, prototyping, design tool, interactive behaviour","pages":14,"abstract":"Astral is a prototyping tool for authoring mobile and smart object interactive behaviours.

To this end, this research explores how to adopt tools and methods that can integrate the best of physical and digital modalities to multiple contexts and scales in HCI and data visualization. Designing information visualization systems creates a need for a design approach that addresses and ties together two main threads – 1) how we as humans interact with and make sense of our environment and 2) how we as designers create meaning through geometry, form, and material encodings. While the research community within data visualization has primarily focused on screen-based data visualizations, there is now an opportunity to study how we can create insight with hybrid physical and digital representations of data through the lens of architectural practice. My colleagues and I have conducted this research at the intersection of model building, diagrams, and generative design, applying this knowledge to the design of multifaceted digital environments, from micro to macro scale, in two- and three- dimensional worlds. To develop this research, we first observe and characterize the architectural methods of model making and their potential to facilitate the design process of interactive systems. Next, we describe how physical hand-crafted and digitally fabricated models of different types assist in various stages of the design process. To illustrate how model building could support fluid exploration of multiple data sets, we built a 3D interactive campus model visualizing multiple layers of building-specific data. The system uses physical models as tangible tokens on an interactive touch surface, visualizing energy use and weather data daily over a two-year period. As an extension of our design, we developed a conceptual framework from this project to highlight the potential of physical models for supporting embodied exploration of spatial and non-spatial visualizations through fluid interaction. We then examine the use of diagrams in architecture and develop a conceptual framework based on the concept of data tectonics to organize and structure the design process of physical and immersive data systems. To further study the use of diagrams and generative design for data visualization, I collaborated with researchers at Tableau Software to develop a patented Tableau extension that self-generates and evolves up to thirty different design permutations at a time. The system randomly assigns a pre-specified palette of mark types to a chosen dataset giving designers the option of adding or deleting options that they deem promising. As a final project for this research, we brought the three principles of model making, diagramming, and generative design together to create a large-scale physical and immersive data visualization. In collaboration with the Department of Social Work at the University of Calgary, the project uses diagrams and generative design to prototype a series of three-dimensional encodings visualizing Global Gender Gap statistics from the World Economic Forum. The tent-like forms evoke sheltering structures that can be registered, experienced, and measured with the whole body. For this project, we applied the diagrammatic approach used in parametric design to traditional information visualization design principles and identified workflows that support rapid exploration and fabrication of multiple data design alternatives. There is no doubt that data and digital technologies, including machine learning and AI, will be part of our human fabric in the future, but what that looks like and how it is structured is still up to us. We need artists, and more diversity in general, in order to do this to the best of our potential as humans. In determining which practices encourage the creation of rich data-driven environments, this research underscores the fundamental need of humans to make sense of the world, inspiring designers to develop new spatial constructs that integrate both the art and science of the built environment.","dir":"content/output/theses","base":"phd-2022-hull.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"phd-2022-hull.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience"]}')},6785:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2020-09","title":"PufferBot: Actuated Expandable Structures for Aerial Robots","authors":["Hooman Hedayati","Ryo Suzuki","Daniel Leithinger","Daniel Szafir"],"series":"IROS 2020","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtPepCxWcBg","pages":6,"abstract":"We present PufferBot, an aerial robot with an expandable structure that may expand to protect a drone’s propellers when the robot is close to obstacles or collocated humans.

This work focuses on improving digital map navigation in AR with mid-air hand gestures, using a horizontal intangible map display. First, we conducted a user study to explore the effects of handedness (unimanual and bimanual) and input mapping (position-based and rate-based). From these findings we designed DiveZoom and TerraceZoom, two novel hybrid techniques that smoothly transition between position- and rate-based mappings. A second user study evaluated these designs.

To increase aﬀordability and portability of force-feedback implementations in DMI design, we designed our platform to be wire-less, self-contained and built from commercially available components. To provide examples of modularity and portability, we integrated TorqueTuner into a standalone haptic knob and into an existing DMI, the T-Stick. We implemented 3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and Exciter), by mapping sensors to sound synthesis in audio programming environment SuperCollider.

As a result, it provides users with a dynamic relationship between inputs and outputs, awareness of current tool selection and parameters, and increased expressive match (e.g., added ability to mimic physical tools, showing clipboard contents).

No single instance of these methods, either in the form of orthographic projections or perspectival representation, can address all questions regarding the design, but as a whole, they demonstrate a comprehensive range of information about the building or object they intend to represent. This explicates an inevitable degree of deficiency in representation, regardless of its type. In addition, perspective-based optical illusions manipulate our spatial perception by deliberately misrepresenting the reality. In this regard, they are not new concepts to architectural representation. As a consequence, Optically Illusive Architecture (OIA) is proposed, not as a solution to fill the gap between the representing and represented spaces, but as a design paradigm whose concept derives from and accounts for this gap. By OIA we aim to cast light to an undeniable role of viewpoints in designing architectural spaces. The idea is to establish a methodology in a way that the deficiency of current representational techniques—manifested as specific thread of optical illusions—flourishes into thoughtful results embodied as actual architectural spaces. Within our design paradigm, we define a framework to be able to effectively analyze its precedents, generate new space, and evaluate their efficiencies. Moreover, the framework raises a hierarchical set of questions to differentiate OIA from a visual gimmick. Furthermore, we study two OIA-driven environments, by conducting empirical studies using Virtual Reality (VR). These studies bear essential information, in terms of design performance, and the public’s ability to engage and interact with an OIA space, prior to the actual fabrication of the structures.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"ijac-2021-hosseini.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"ijac-2021-hosseini.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},9755:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2022-10","title":"Prototyping Soft Devices with Interactive Bioplastics","authors":["Marion Koelle","Madalina Nicolae","Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Marc Teyssier","J\xfcrgen Steimle"],"series":"UIST 2022","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3526113.3545623","keywords":"bioplastics, biomaterials, do-it-yourself, DIY, sustainability","award":"Best Paper","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Paq3P3EsKQ","pages":16,"abstract":"Designers and makers are increasingly interested in leveraging bio-based and bio-degradable ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) materials for sustainable prototyping.

In this paper, we contribute a DIY approach for creating Interactive Bioplastics that is accessible to a wide audience, making use of easy-to-obtain bio-based raw materials and familiar tools. We present three types of conductive bioplastic materials and their formulation: sheets, pastes and foams. Our materials enable additive and subtractive fabrication of soft circuits and sensors. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these materials can substitute conventional prototyping materials, be combined with off-the-shelf electronics, and be fed into a sustainable material ‘life-cycle’ including disassembly, re-use, and re-melting of materials.

Building on existing human-based telepresence approaches (e.g. ChameleonMask), we contribute a novel method to teleoperate a human surrogate through synchronized mixed reality (MR) hand gestural navigation and verbal communication. By overlaying the remote instructor\'s virtual hands in the local user\'s MR view, the remote instructor can guide and control the local user as if they were physically present. This allows the local user/surrogate to synchronize their hand movements and gestures with the remote instructor, effectively ``teleoperating\'\' a real human.

We present SparseIMU, a rapid method for selecting minimal inertial sensor-based layouts for effective gesture recognition.

We performed a series of analyses, including an evaluation of the entire combinatorial space for freehand and grasping microgestures (393K layouts), and quantified the performance across different layout choices, revealing new gesture detection opportunities with IMUs. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our method with four scenarios.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tochi-2022-nittala.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tochi-2022-nittala.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["diff"]}')},9983:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2025-04","title":"IntelliLining: Activity Sensing through Textile Interlining Sensors Using TENGs","authors":["Mahdie GhaneEzabadi","Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Xing-Dong Yang","Te-yen Wu"],"series":"CHI 2025","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3706598.3713167","keywords":"Interactive textile, TENGs, Machine learning, Vibration sensing","abstract":"We introduce a novel component for smart garments: smart interlining, and validate its technical feasibility through a series of experiments. Our work involved the implementation of a prototype that employs a textile vibration sensor based on Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs), commonly used for activity detection. We explore several unique features of smart interlining, including how sensor signals and patterns are influenced by factors such as the size and shape of the interlining sensor, the location of the vibration source within the sensor area, and various propagation media, such as airborne and surface vibrations. We present our study results and discuss how these findings support the feasibility of smart interlining. Additionally, we demonstrate that smart interlinings on a shirt can detect a variety of user activities involving the hand, mouth, and upper body, achieving an accuracy rate of 93.9% in the tested activities.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2025-ghaneezabadi.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2025-ghaneezabadi.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["diff"]}')}}]);
