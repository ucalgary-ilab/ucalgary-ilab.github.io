From our interdisciplinary position we identify gaps in existing research and offer novel solutions and innovative frameworks for navigating and structuring experiences within VR. In pursuit of answers to our research questions, we contribute C1) Performance-Based Multimodal Methodological Approaches for HCI, and C2) A Demonstration of Interdisciplinary Possibilities to the landscape of HCI VR research.
