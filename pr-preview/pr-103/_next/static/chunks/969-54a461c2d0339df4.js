Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children\'s stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child\'s playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children\'s stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children\'s mental health.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"imwut-2020-wang.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"imwut-2020-wang.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["utouch"]}')},588:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2017-01","title":"Embedded Data Representations","authors":["Wesley Willett","Yvonne Jansen","Pierre Dragicevic"],"series":"TVCG 2017","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598608","keywords":"information visualization, data physicalization, ambient displays, ubiquitous computing, augmented reality","pages":10,"video":"https://vimeo.com/182971005","talk":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS7lU60xChI","abstract":"We introduce embedded data representations, the use of visual and physical representations of data that are deeply integrated with the physical spaces, objects, and entities to which the data refers.

TRAVIS II is an augmented acoustic violin with touch sensors integrated into its 3-D printed fingerboard that track left-hand finger gestures in real time. The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament that produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. Although these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four sensors attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. Although the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin. Our design allows violinists to naturally create music for interactive performance and improvisation without requiring new instrumental techniques. The first author composed two compositions to highlight TRAVIS II: “Dream State” and “Kindred Dichotomy.” Both of these compositions involve improvisation in their creative process and include interactive visuals.

Then, twenty musically trained participants evaluated three haptic modes (No-force feedback (No-FF), Spring, and Detent) by performing a vibrato mimicry task, rating their experience on a Likert scale, and providing qualitative feedback in post-experiment interviews. The study assessed objective performance metrics (Pitch Error and Pitch Deviation) and subjective user experience ratings (Comfort, Ease of Control, and Helpfulness) of each haptic mode. User experience results showed that participants found force feedback helpful. Performance results showed that the Detent mode significantly improved pitch accuracy and vibrato stability compared to No-FF, while the Spring mode did not show a similar improvement. Post-experiment interviews showed that preferences for Spring and Detent modes varied, and the applicants provided suggestions for future knob designs.

For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tvcg-2019-walny.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tvcg-2019-walny.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience","shivers"]}')},4536:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2021-06","title":"Participatory Art for Public Exploration of Algorithmic Decision-Making","authors":["Kathryn Blair","Pil Hansen","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"DIS 2021","doi":"10.1145/3461778.3462068","keywords":"Fine Arts, Physical Artifact, Education, Social Impact of Technology, Education, Participatory Art Installation","pages":4,"abstract":"Machine learning and predictive algorithms find patterns in large stores of data and make predictions which corporations and governments use to support decision-making.

We interviewed five professional improvisers about their use of physical props in improv, and their expectations of a possible augmented prop that controls technical theatre elements. We propose a set of guidelines for the design of an augmented prop that fits with the existing world of unpredictable improvised performance.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tei-2019-mikalauskas.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tei-2019-mikalauskas.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},9073:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2019-06","title":"Sketching and Ideation Activities for Situated Visualization Design","authors":["Nathalie Bressa","Kendra Wannamaker","Henrik Korsgaard","Wesley Willett","Jo Vermeulen"],"series":"DIS 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3322276.3322326","keywords":"ideation, design workshops, situated visualization, information visualization, small displays, sketching","abstract":"We report on findings from seven design workshops that used ideation and sketching activities to prototype new situated visualizations - representations of data that are displayed in proximity to the physical referents (such as people, objects, and locations) to which the data is related.

No single instance of these methods, either in the form of orthographic projections or perspectival representation, can address all questions regarding the design, but as a whole, they demonstrate a comprehensive range of information about the building or object they intend to represent. This explicates an inevitable degree of deficiency in representation, regardless of its type. In addition, perspective-based optical illusions manipulate our spatial perception by deliberately misrepresenting the reality. In this regard, they are not new concepts to architectural representation. As a consequence, Optically Illusive Architecture (OIA) is proposed, not as a solution to fill the gap between the representing and represented spaces, but as a design paradigm whose concept derives from and accounts for this gap. By OIA we aim to cast light to an undeniable role of viewpoints in designing architectural spaces. The idea is to establish a methodology in a way that the deficiency of current representational techniques—manifested as specific thread of optical illusions—flourishes into thoughtful results embodied as actual architectural spaces. Within our design paradigm, we define a framework to be able to effectively analyze its precedents, generate new space, and evaluate their efficiencies. Moreover, the framework raises a hierarchical set of questions to differentiate OIA from a visual gimmick. Furthermore, we study two OIA-driven environments, by conducting empirical studies using Virtual Reality (VR). These studies bear essential information, in terms of design performance, and the public’s ability to engage and interact with an OIA space, prior to the actual fabrication of the structures.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"ijac-2021-hosseini.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"ijac-2021-hosseini.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},9755:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2022-10","title":"Prototyping Soft Devices with Interactive Bioplastics","authors":["Marion Koelle","Madalina Nicolae","Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Marc Teyssier","J\xfcrgen Steimle"],"series":"UIST 2022","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3526113.3545623","keywords":"bioplastics, biomaterials, do-it-yourself, DIY, sustainability","award":"Best Paper","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Paq3P3EsKQ","pages":16,"abstract":"Designers and makers are increasingly interested in leveraging bio-based and bio-degradable ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) materials for sustainable prototyping.
