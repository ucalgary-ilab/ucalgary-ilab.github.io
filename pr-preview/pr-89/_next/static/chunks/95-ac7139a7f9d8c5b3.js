While available refreshable displays can dynamically change the content, they are still too expensive for many users, and are limited in size. These factors limit wide-spread adoption and the representation of large graphics or data sets. In this paper, we present FluxMaker, an inexpensive scalable system that renders dynamic information on top of static tactile graphics with movable tactile markers. These dynamic tactile markers can be easily reconfigured and used to annotate static raised line tactile graphics, including maps, graphs, and diagrams. We developed a hardware prototype that actuates magnetic tactile markers driven by low-cost and scalable electromagnetic coil arrays, which can be fabricated with standard printed circuit board manufacturing. We evaluate our prototype with six participants with visual impairments and found positive results across four application areas: location finding or navigating on tactile maps, data analysis, and physicalization, feature identification for tactile graphics, and drawing support. The user study confirms advantages in application domains such as education and data exploration.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"assets-2017-suzuki.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"assets-2017-suzuki.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/assets-2023-mok.json":{"date":"2023-10","title":"Experiences of Autistic Twitch Livestreamers: “I have made easily the most meaningful and impactful relationships”","authors":["Terrance Mok","Anthony Tang","Adam McCrimmon","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"ASSETS 2023","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3597638.3608416","keywords":"autism, live streaming, autistic, Twitch","abstract":"We present perspectives from 10 autistic Twitch streamers regarding their experiences as livestreamers and how autism uniquely colors their experiences.

Reading and interpreting topography and relief on terrain maps is an important aspect of map use, but extracting depth information from 2D maps is notoriously difficult. Modern mapping software attempts to alleviate this limitation by presenting digital terrain using 3D views. However, 3D views introduce occlusion, complicate distance estimations, and typically require more complex interactions. In contrast, our approach reveals depth information via shearing animations on 2D maps, and can be paired with existing interactions such as pan and zoom. We examine explicit, integrated, and hybrid interactions for triggering relief shearing and present a version that uses device tilt to control depth effects. Our evaluation shows that these interactive techniques improve depth perception when compared to standard 2D and perspective views.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2015-willett.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2015-willett.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2017-aoki.json":{"date":"2017-05","title":"Environmental Protection and Agency: Motivations, Capacity, and Goals in Participatory Sensing","authors":["Paul Aoki","Allison Woodruff","Baladitya Yellapragada","Wesley Willett"],"series":"CHI 2017","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025667","keywords":"citizen science, environmental sensing","pages":13,"abstract":"In this paper we consider various genres of citizen science from the perspective of citizen participants.

To mitigate this, we created Pineal, a design tool that lets end-users: (1) modify 3D models to include a smart watch or phone as its heart; (2) specify high-level interactive behaviours through visual programming; and (3) have the phone or watch act out such behaviours as the objects\' \\"smarts\\".

We demonstrate that this framework can also be used to describe interaction cues for augmented reality applications. Beyond this, we show how the framework can be used to generatively derive new design ideas for visual interaction cues in augmented reality experiences.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"chi-2018-dillman.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"chi-2018-dillman.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/chi-2018-feick.json":{"date":"2018-04","title":"Perspective on and Re-orientation of Physical Proxies in Object-Focused Remote Collaboration","authors":["Martin Feick","Terrance Tin Hoi Mok","Anthony Tang","Lora Oehlberg","Ehud Sharlin"],"series":"CHI 2018","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3173574.3173855","keywords":"cscw, remote collaboration, object-focused collaboration, physical telepresence, collaborative physical tasks","pages":13,"award":"Honorable Mention","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfxTHsPJWHY","abstract":"Remote collaborators working together on physical objects have difficulty building a shared understanding of what each person is talking about.

The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament that produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string.

These results suggest that gesture designers need to account for scale, and should not simply reuse gestures across different hologram sizes.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"dis-2018-pham.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"dis-2018-pham.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/dis-2018-ta.json":{"date":"2018-06","title":"Bod-IDE: An Augmented Reality Sandbox for eFashion Garments","authors":["Kevin Ta","Ehud Sharlin","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"DIS 2018","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3197391.3205408","keywords":"augmented reality, electronic fashion, creativity support tool","pages":5,"abstract":"Electronic fashion (eFashion) garments use technology to augment the human body with wearable interaction.

No single instance of these methods, either in the form of orthographic projections or perspectival representation, can address all questions regarding the design, but as a whole, they demonstrate a comprehensive range of information about the building or object they intend to represent. This explicates an inevitable degree of deficiency in representation, regardless of its type. In addition, perspective-based optical illusions manipulate our spatial perception by deliberately misrepresenting the reality. In this regard, they are not new concepts to architectural representation. As a consequence, Optically Illusive Architecture (OIA) is proposed, not as a solution to fill the gap between the representing and represented spaces, but as a design paradigm whose concept derives from and accounts for this gap. By OIA we aim to cast light to an undeniable role of viewpoints in designing architectural spaces. The idea is to establish a methodology in a way that the deficiency of current representational techniques—manifested as specific thread of optical illusions—flourishes into thoughtful results embodied as actual architectural spaces. Within our design paradigm, we define a framework to be able to effectively analyze its precedents, generate new space, and evaluate their efficiencies.

Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children\'s stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child\'s playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children\'s stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children\'s mental health.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"imwut-2020-wang.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"imwut-2020-wang.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/imx-2020-mok.json":{"date":"2020-06","title":"Talk Like Somebody is Watching: Understanding and Supporting Novice Live Streamers","authors":["Terrance Mok","Colin Au Yeung","Anthony Tang","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"IMX 2020","doi":"10.1145/3391614.3399392","keywords":"Live streams, Streamers, Chatbot, Audience, Virtual audience","pages":6,"abstract":"We built a chatbot system–Audience Bot–that simulates an audience for novice live streamers to engage with while streaming.

Then, twenty musically trained participants evaluated three haptic modes (No-force feedback (No-FF), Spring, and Detent) by performing a vibrato mimicry task, rating their experience on a Likert scale, and providing qualitative feedback in post-experiment interviews. The study assessed objective performance metrics (Pitch Error and Pitch Deviation) and subjective user experience ratings (Comfort, Ease of Control, and Helpfulness) of each haptic mode. User experience results showed that participants found force feedback helpful. Performance results showed that the Detent mode significantly improved pitch accuracy and vibrato stability compared to No-FF, while the Spring mode did not show a similar improvement. Post-experiment interviews showed that preferences for Spring and Detent modes varied, and the applicants provided suggestions for future knob designs. These findings suggest that force feedback may enhance both control and the experience of control in rotary knobs, with potential applications for more nuanced control in DMIs.","github":"https://github.com/piaoziyue/Bend-aid-Actuators-2024","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"mdpi-actuators-2024-piao.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"mdpi-actuators-2024-piao.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"},"content/output/publications/mdpi-arts-2023-frisson.json":{"date":"2023-09","title":"Challenges and Opportunities of Force Feedback in Music","authors":["Christian Frisson","Marcelo M.

We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations.

To demonstrate the idea, we describe the design and implementation of Dynablock, a working prototype of a dynamic 3D printer. Dynablock can form a three-dimensional shape in seconds by assembling 3,000 9 mm blocks, leveraging a 24 x 16 pin-based shape display as a parallel assembler.

To address this limitation, we explore both expressive and improvisational AR sketched animation by introducing a set of responsive scribble animation techniques that can be directly embedded through sketching interactions: 1) object binding, 2) flip-book animation, 3) action trigger, 4) particle effects, 5) motion trajectory, and 6) contour highlight. These six animation effects were derived from the analysis of 172 existing video-edited scribble animations. We showcase these techniques through various applications, such as video creation, augmented education, storytelling, and AR prototyping.

Then, in the ’70s, personal computers \'moved in\' with users. In the ’90s, mobile devices moved computing into users’ pockets. More recently, wearable devices brought computing into constant physical contact with the user’s skin. These transitions proved useful: moving closer to users allowed interactive devices to sense more of their user and act more personal. The main question that drives my research is: what is the next interface paradigm that supersedes wearable devices? The primary way researchers have been investigating this is by asking where future interactive devices will be located with respect to the user’s body. Many posit that the next generation of interfaces will be implanted inside the user’s body. However, I argue that their location with respect to the user’s body is not the primary factor; in fact, implanted devices are already happening in that we have pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc. Instead, I argue that the key factor is how devices will integrate with the user’s biological senses and actuators. This body-device integration allowed us to engineer interactive devices that intentionally borrow parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body. For example, one such type of body-integrated devices, which I have advanced recently, are interactive systems based on electrical muscle stimulation. These devices move their user’s muscles using computer-controlled electrical impulses, achieving the functionality of robotic exoskeletons without the bulky motors. The key insight is that engineering devices that intentionally borrow parts of the user’s biology puts forward a new generation of miniaturized devices; allowing us to circumvent traditional physical constraints. For instance, in the case of our devices based on electrical muscle stimulation, they demonstrate how our body-device integration circumvents the constraints imposed by the ratio of electrical power and size of a motor (i.e., the stronger/larger a motor is, the more current needed to actuate it). Taking this further, we demonstrate how our body-device integration approach allowed us to also miniaturize thermal feedback (hot/cold sensations) without the need for power-hungry devices like Peltiers, air conditioners, or heaters. We believe that these bodily-integrated devices are the natural succession to wearable interfaces and allow us to investigate how interfaces might connect to our bodies in a more direct and personal way.","bio":"Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago.

What holds widely adopted use back is the limited ability to modify and fabricate existing models. It may seem like a portable format already exist, as laser cut models are already widely shared in the form of 2D cutting plans. However, such files are susceptible to variations in cutter properties (aka kerf) and do not allow modifying the model in any meaningful way. I consider this format machine specific. In computing, this problem was solved in the 50s by developing compilers. This allowed developers to abstract away from the hardware and as a result, write code that remained relevant to this day. The resulting code is portable, e.g. it can be transferred from one machine to another. This transition has revolutionized not only computing but also all fields that use digital formats like desktop publishing, digital video, digital audio, etc. I believe that by transitioning towards a portable format for laser cutting we can make a similar transition from 1000s of users and one-off models towards millions of users and advanced models developed by multiple creators.

I wrote software tools to modify 2D cutting plans, replacing non-portable elements with portable counterparts. This makes the models portable, but it is still hard to modify them. I thus take a more radical approach, which is to move to a 3D exchange format (kyub). This guarantees portability by generating a new machine-specific 2D cutting plan for the local machine when exported. And the models inherently allow for parametric modifications. Instead, it raises the question of compatibility: Files already exist in 2D—how to get them into 3D? I demonstrate a software tool, assembler3, to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the model encoded in a 2D cutting plan, allows modifying it using a 3D editor, and re-encodes it to a 2D cutting plan. I demonstrate how this approach allows me to make a much wider range of modifications, including scaling, changing material thickness, and even remixing models.","bio":"Thijs Roumen is a PhD candidate in Human Computer Interaction in the lab of Patrick Baudisch, Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.

It is widely recognized that these interaction patterns vary culturally; the advent of autonomy will necessitate a more explicit understanding of the complex manner in which drivers interact. Mismatches in perception, understanding and action between road users can easily cause accidents. We are exploring how drivers implicitly communicate and coordinate with others on the road, and to assess how these driving interactions differ across cultures. By staging situations that demand negotiation, such as ambiguous four-way stops, we can capture how participants communicate with other drivers or pedestrians to coordinate joint action, implicitly through the movements of their virtual car or bodily movement, or explicitly through verbal or gestural exchange. By comparing how people from different cultures coordinate in comparable situations, we can better understand cultural differences in driving interaction.","bio":"Wendy Ju is an Associate Professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech and the Technion and in the Information Science field at Cornell University.
