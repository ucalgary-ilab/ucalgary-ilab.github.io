Even if one does not clearly know what the metaverse is or will become, it is quite clear that in recent years, and with a specific intensity since the Covid-19 pandemic hit, we are witnessing the rise of emergent formats and practices of live performance combined with XR technologies and platforms. From medium to large live acting performances in XR such as the ones produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company, Ferryman Collective, Double-Eye Studios or La Cuarta Pared VR, to seemingly spontaneous performative moments such as poetry slams on VR Chat or Rec Room, live performance is an essential part of a post-pandemic future where digital performance will play a key role in giving live to the metaverse. In this keynote presentation, XR researcher and performer AntÃ³nio BaÃ­a Reis will provide an overview of the main concepts and ideas related to live performance in XR, as well as the main potentialities and challenges surrounding the future of performing arts in the metaverse experience economy.</p><h2>Bio</h2><p>Antonio BaÃa Reis is a researcher, professor, and digital artist.

Having an expert surgeon either travel to the patient or operate remotely through surgical robots is not scalable given the staggering shortage of more than 140 million surgeries annually. I propose to move away from surgical _delegation_ and towards surgical _education_ with the goal of studying and building interactive systems that innovate how surgery is learned, in a vision to reverse the alarming trend of fewer surgeons per population. I will talk about two of my research directions. First, surgical telementoring, when an expert surgeon both remotely assists and teaches a surgeon in real-time while they operate. My aim is to move telementoring forward from the sheer transmission of audio and video, by conceptualizing novel mechanisms that shatter the boundaries of face-to-face settings. Second, interactive videos as learning material both produced and used by surgeons. My aim is to move the creation and consumption of videos away from classic video editing and playback tools, by conceptualizing novel mechanisms that rely on embedded semantic information in various dimensions. Together, these two directions target the alarmingly decreasing rate of surgeons per population and difficult access to surgical care that goes with it, supporting expert-to-expert remote training and expert-to-novice asynchronous training.</p><h2>Bio</h2><p>Ignacio Avellino is a permanent researcher (Charg de Recherche) for the CNRS at Sorbonne Universite, France.

Then, in the ’70s, personal computers &#x27;moved in&#x27; with users. In the ’90s, mobile devices moved computing into users’ pockets. More recently, wearable devices brought computing into constant physical contact with the user’s skin. These transitions proved useful: moving closer to users allowed interactive devices to sense more of their user and act more personal. The main question that drives my research is: what is the next interface paradigm that supersedes wearable devices? The primary way researchers have been investigating this is by asking where future interactive devices will be located with respect to the user’s body. Many posit that the next generation of interfaces will be implanted inside the user’s body. However, I argue that their location with respect to the user’s body is not the primary factor; in fact, implanted devices are already happening in that we have pacemakers, insulin pumps, etc. Instead, I argue that the key factor is how devices will integrate with the user’s biological senses and actuators. This body-device integration allowed us to engineer interactive devices that intentionally borrow parts of the body for input and output, rather than adding more technology to the body. For example, one such type of body-integrated devices, which I have advanced recently, are interactive systems based on electrical muscle stimulation. These devices move their user’s muscles using computer-controlled electrical impulses, achieving the functionality of robotic exoskeletons without the bulky motors. The key insight is that engineering devices that intentionally borrow parts of the user’s biology puts forward a new generation of miniaturized devices; allowing us to circumvent traditional physical constraints. For instance, in the case of our devices based on electrical muscle stimulation, they demonstrate how our body-device integration circumvents the constraints imposed by the ratio of electrical power and size of a motor (i.e., the stronger/larger a motor is, the more current needed to actuate it). Taking this further, we demonstrate how our body-device integration approach allowed us to also miniaturize thermal feedback (hot/cold sensations) without the need for power-hungry devices like Peltiers, air conditioners, or heaters. We believe that these bodily-integrated devices are the natural succession to wearable interfaces and allow us to investigate how interfaces might connect to our bodies in a more direct and personal way.</p><h2>Bio</h2><p>Pedro Lopes is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Chicago. Pedro focuses onintegrating computer interfaces with the human body—exploring the interface paradigm that supersedes wearable computing. Some of these new integrated-devices include: muscle stimulation wearable that allows users to manipulate tools they have never seen before or that accelerate their reaction time, or a device that leverages the sense of smell to create an illusion of temperature. Pedro’s work has received a number ofacademic awards, such as four ACM CHI/UIST Best Papers. It also captured the interest of the media, such asNew York Times or Wired and was exhibited at Ars Electronica &amp; World Economic Forum.

To enrich the literature for making movable 3D-printed parts and support a wider spectrum of applications, I introduce the concept of “print driver”, a class of parametric mechanisms that use uniquely designed mechanical elements and are printed in place to augment 3D-printed objects with the ability of deformation, actuation, and sensing. In this talk, I will present a series of my research works to showcase how the print drivers can be used to lower the barrier for making 3D-printed kinetic objects and to support augmented 3D printable behaviors for interactivity. I will also share my personal thoughts on how to incorporate print drivers into objects, the human body, and space for good.</p><h2>Bio</h2><p>Liang He is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Jon E.

What holds widely adopted use back is the limited ability to modify and fabricate existing models. It may seem like a portable format already exist, as laser cut models are already widely shared in the form of 2D cutting plans. However, such files are susceptible to variations in cutter properties (aka kerf) and do not allow modifying the model in any meaningful way. I consider this format machine specific. In computing, this problem was solved in the 50s by developing compilers. This allowed developers to abstract away from the hardware and as a result, write code that remained relevant to this day. The resulting code is portable, e.g. it can be transferred from one machine to another. This transition has revolutionized not only computing but also all fields that use digital formats like desktop publishing, digital video, digital audio, etc. I believe that by transitioning towards a portable format for laser cutting we can make a similar transition from 1000s of users and one-off models towards millions of users and advanced models developed by multiple creators. My first take on the challenge is to see how far we get by building on the de-facto standard, i.e., 2D cutting plans. I wrote software tools to modify 2D cutting plans, replacing non-portable elements with portable counterparts. This makes the models portable, but it is still hard to modify them. I thus take a more radical approach, which is to move to a 3D exchange format (kyub). This guarantees portability by generating a new machine-specific 2D cutting plan for the local machine when exported. And the models inherently allow for parametric modifications. Instead, it raises the question of compatibility: Files already exist in 2D—how to get them into 3D? I demonstrate a software tool, assembler3, to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the model encoded in a 2D cutting plan, allows modifying it using a 3D editor, and re-encodes it to a 2D cutting plan. I demonstrate how this approach allows me to make a much wider range of modifications, including scaling, changing material thickness, and even remixing models.</p><h2>Bio</h2><p>Thijs Roumen is a PhD candidate in Human Computer Interaction in the lab of Patrick Baudisch, Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany.

It is widely recognized that these interaction patterns vary culturally; the advent of autonomy will necessitate a more explicit understanding of the complex manner in which drivers interact. Mismatches in perception, understanding and action between road users can easily cause accidents. We are exploring how drivers implicitly communicate and coordinate with others on the road, and to assess how these driving interactions differ across cultures. By staging situations that demand negotiation, such as ambiguous four-way stops, we can capture how participants communicate with other drivers or pedestrians to coordinate joint action, implicitly through the movements of their virtual car or bodily movement, or explicitly through verbal or gestural exchange. By comparing how people from different cultures coordinate in comparable situations, we can better understand cultural differences in driving interaction.</p><h2>Bio</h2><p>Wendy Ju is an Associate Professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech and the Technion and in the Information Science field at Cornell University.

In this effort, various types of generic devices of actuated TUIs have been investigated including pin-based shape displays, actuated curve interfaces, and swarm user interfaces. While these approaches are intended to be dynamically reconfigurable to offer generic interactivity, each hardware is inherently limited to the fixed configurations. How can we further expand the versatility of the actuated TUIs for fully expanding their capability for tangible interactions and motion / shape representations?

In my talk, I propose a ‘mechanical shell’, a design concept for actuated TUIs with modular interchangeable components that extends and converts the shape, motion, and interactivity of the hardware. By doing so, compared with the actuated TUI itself, each mechanical shell would bring much more specialized and customized interactivity, while, as the whole architecture, the system can adapt to much more versatile interactions. I present two research instances that demonstrate this concept based-on pin-based shape display and swarm user interface, and introduce proof-of-concept implementation as well as a range of applications.
