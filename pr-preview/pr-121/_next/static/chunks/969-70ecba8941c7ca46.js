Following the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan, we witnessed a shift of toy block play behavior in young children who suffered from stress after the disaster. The behavior reflected their emotional responses to the traumatic event. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using data captured from block-play to assess children\'s stress after a major natural disaster. We prototyped sets of sensor-embedded toy blocks, AssessBlocks, that automate quantitative play data acquisition. During a three-year period, the blocks were dispatched to fifty-two post-disaster children. Within a free play session, we captured block features, a child\'s playing behavior, and stress evaluated by several methods. The result from our analysis reveal correlations between block play features and stress measurements and show initial promise of using the effectiveness of using AssessBlocks to assess children\'s stress after a disaster. We provide detailed insights into the potential as well as the challenges of our approach and unique conditions. From these insights we summarize guidelines for future research in automated play assessment systems that support children\'s mental health.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"imwut-2020-wang.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"imwut-2020-wang.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["utouch"]}')},588:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2017-01","title":"Embedded Data Representations","authors":["Wesley Willett","Yvonne Jansen","Pierre Dragicevic"],"series":"TVCG 2017","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598608","keywords":"information visualization, data physicalization, ambient displays, ubiquitous computing, augmented reality","pages":10,"video":"https://vimeo.com/182971005","talk":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS7lU60xChI","abstract":"We introduce embedded data representations, the use of visual and physical representations of data that are deeply integrated with the physical spaces, objects, and entities to which the data refers.

To mitigate these problems we contribute proxemic-aware controls, which exploit the spatial relationships between a person\'s handheld device and all surrounding appliances to create a dynamic appliance control interface. Specifically, a person can discover and select an appliance by the way one orients a mobile device around the room, and then progressively view the appliance\'s status and control its features in increasing detail by simply moving towards it. We illustrate proxemic-aware controls of assorted appliances through various scenarios. We then provide a generalized conceptual framework that informs future designs of proxemic-aware controls.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"mobilehci-2015-ledo.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"mobilehci-2015-ledo.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},2192:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2021-10","title":"HapticBots: Distributed Encountered-type Haptics for VR with Multiple Shape-changing Mobile Robots","authors":["Ryo Suzuki","Eyal Ofek","Mike Sinclair","Daniel Leithinger","Mar Gonzalez-Franco"],"series":"UIST 2021","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3472749.3474821","keywords":"virtual reality, encountered-type haptics, tabletop mobile robots, swarm user interfaces","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTiZgOESJyQ","pages":16,"abstract":"HapticBots introduces a novel encountered-type haptic approach for Virtual Reality (VR) based on multiple tabletop-size shape-changing robots.

TRAVIS II is an augmented acoustic violin with touch sensors integrated into its 3-D printed fingerboard that track left-hand finger gestures in real time. The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament that produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. Although these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four sensors attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. Although the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin. Our design allows violinists to naturally create music for interactive performance and improvisation without requiring new instrumental techniques. The first author composed two compositions to highlight TRAVIS II: “Dream State” and “Kindred Dichotomy.” Both of these compositions involve improvisation in their creative process and include interactive visuals. In this article we describe the design of the instrument, experiments leading to the sensing fingerboard, performative applications of the instrument, and compositional considerations for the resultant pieces.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"cmj-2020-ko.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"cmj-2020-ko.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},3167:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2019-06","title":"Mannequette: Understanding and Enabling Collaboration and Creativity on Avant-Garde Fashion-Tech Runways","authors":["Teddy Seyed","Anthony Tang"],"series":"DIS 2019","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3322276.3322305","keywords":"fashion, haute couture, e-textiles, maker culture, fashion-tech, wearables, avant-garde, haute-tech couture, modular","award":"Honorable Mention","pages":13,"abstract":"Drawing upon multiple disciplines, avant-garde fashion-tech teams push the boundaries between fashion and technology.

From the created visualizations, we observed several unique traits and uses of block-printing tools for visualization authoring, including: modularity of patterns, annotation guides, creation of multiple patterns from one stamp, and various techniques to apply data onto paper. We discuss the issues around expressivity and effectiveness of block-printed stamps in visualization authoring, and identify implications for the design and assembly of primitives in potential visualization stamp kits, as well as applications for future use in non-digital environments.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tei-2019-wun.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tei-2019-wun.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},4350:(e,t,a)=>{"use strict";a.r(t),a.d(t,{__N_SSG:()=>p,default:()=>m});var i=a(7876),s=a(4232),o=a(6649),n=a(2079),r=a(7837),c=a(8244),l=a(9011),d=a(6075);a(7328);var u=a(2649);class h extends s.Component{render(){if(this.props.id)return(0,i.jsxs)(i.Fragment,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(d.A,{title:(0,o.Ay)(this.publication.title),description:this.publication.abstract,image:"/static/images/publications/cover/".concat(this.props.id,".jpg"),keywords:this.publication.keywords}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"pusher",children:(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"ui stackable grid",children:[(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"one wide column"}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"ten wide column centered",style:{marginTop:"30px"},children:(0,i.jsx)(u.default,{publication:this.publication,namesId:this.namesId,people:this.people,booktitles:r,files:c,vimeo:l})}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"one wide column"})]})})]})}constructor(e){super(e);let t=Object.keys(n.P).filter(e=>e.includes("people"));for(let e of(this.people=[],t)){let t=e.split("/")[3].replace(".json",""),a=Object.assign(n.P[e],{id:t});this.people.push(a)}for(let e of(this.namesId={},this.people))this.namesId[e.name]=e.id,void 0!==e.alias&&(this.namesId[e.alias]=e.id);if(!this.props.id)return;this.publication=a(5221)("./".concat(this.props.id,".json"))}}var p=!0;let m=h},4362:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2017-01","title":"An Exploratory Study of Word-Scale Graphics in Data-Rich Text Documents","authors":["Pascal Goffin","Jeremy Boy","Wesley Willett","Petra Isenberg"],"series":"TVCG 2017","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2618797","keywords":"word-scale visualization, word-scale graphic, text visualization, sparklines, authoring tool, information visualization","pages":13,"video":"https://vimeo.com/230834366","abstract":"We contribute an investigation of the design and function of word-scale graphics and visualizations embedded in text documents.

Then, twenty musically trained participants evaluated three haptic modes (No-force feedback (No-FF), Spring, and Detent) by performing a vibrato mimicry task, rating their experience on a Likert scale, and providing qualitative feedback in post-experiment interviews. The study assessed objective performance metrics (Pitch Error and Pitch Deviation) and subjective user experience ratings (Comfort, Ease of Control, and Helpfulness) of each haptic mode. User experience results showed that participants found force feedback helpful. Performance results showed that the Detent mode significantly improved pitch accuracy and vibrato stability compared to No-FF, while the Spring mode did not show a similar improvement. Post-experiment interviews showed that preferences for Spring and Detent modes varied, and the applicants provided suggestions for future knob designs. These findings suggest that force feedback may enhance both control and the experience of control in rotary knobs, with potential applications for more nuanced control in DMIs.","github":"https://github.com/piaoziyue/Bend-aid-Actuators-2024","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"mdpi-actuators-2024-piao.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"mdpi-actuators-2024-piao.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["shivers"]}')},4366:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2022-04","title":"Next Steps in Epidermal Computing: Opportunities and Challenges for Soft On-Skin Devices","authors":["Aditya Shekhar Nittala","J\xfcrgen Steimle"],"series":"CHI 2022","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3491102.3517668","keywords":"wearable devices, epidermal devices, survey, soft wearables","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj9Yk5IQsok","pages":22,"abstract":"Skin is a promising interaction medium and has been widely explored for mobile, and expressive interaction.

In contrast, bi-directional sketching interaction allows the seamless coupling between sketches and actuated TUIs. In this paper, we employ tabletop-size small robots (Sony Toio) and an iPad-based AR sketching tool to demonstrate the concept. In our system, virtual sketches drawn and simulated on an iPad (e.g., lines, walls, pendulums, and springs) can move, actuate, collide, and constrain physical Toio robots, as if virtual sketches and the physical objects exist in the same space through seamless coupling between AR and robot motion.

We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"tvcg-2019-walny.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"tvcg-2019-walny.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience","shivers"]}')},4536:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2021-06","title":"Participatory Art for Public Exploration of Algorithmic Decision-Making","authors":["Kathryn Blair","Pil Hansen","Lora Oehlberg"],"series":"DIS 2021","doi":"10.1145/3461778.3462068","keywords":"Fine Arts, Physical Artifact, Education, Social Impact of Technology, Education, Participatory Art Installation","pages":4,"abstract":"Machine learning and predictive algorithms find patterns in large stores of data and make predictions which corporations and governments use to support decision-making.

We also outline the space of design activities for situated visualization and highlight promising methods for both designers and researchers.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"dis-2019-bressa.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"dis-2019-bressa.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["data-experience"]}')},9126:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2022-10","title":"Mixels: Fabricating Interfaces using Programmable Magnetic Pixels","authors":["Martin Nisser","Yashaswini Makaram","Lucian Covarrubias","Amadou Bah","Faraz Faruqi","Ryo Suzuki","Stefanie Mueller"],"series":"UIST 2022","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3526113.3545698","keywords":"programmable materials, magnetic interfaces, fabrication","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SvFCQkVFtw","pages":12,"abstract":"In this paper, we present Mixels, programmable magnetic pixels that can be rapidly fabricated using an electromagnetic printhead mounted on an off-the-shelve 3-axis CNC machine.

To facilitate the creation of interactive objects with Mixels, we provide a user interface that lets users specify the high-level magnetic behavior and that then computes the underlying magnetic pixel assignments and fabrication instructions to program the magnetic surface. Our custom hardware add-on based on an electromagnetic printhead and hall effect sensor clips onto a standard 3-axis CNC machine and can both write and read magnetic pixel values from magnetic material. Our evaluation shows that our system can reliably program and read magnetic pixels of various strengths, that we can predict the behavior of two interacting magnetic surfaces before programming them, that our electromagnet is strong enough to create pixels that utilize the maximum magnetic strength of the material being programmed, and that this material remains magnetized when removed from the magnetic plotter.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"uist-2022-nisser.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"uist-2022-nisser.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml"}')},9142:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2020-02","title":"LiftTiles: Constructive Building Blocks for Prototyping Room-scale Shape-changing Interfaces","authors":["Ryo Suzuki","Ryosuke Nakayama","Dan Liu","Yasuaki Kakehi","Mark D.

Each actuator can change its height from 15cm to 150cm, actuated and controlled by air pressure. Each unit is low-cost (8 USD), lightweight (10 kg), compact (15 cm), and robust, making it well-suited for prototyping room-scale shape transformations. Moreover, our modular and reconfigurable design allows researchers and designers to quickly construct different geometries and to explore various applications.

We implemented 3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and Exciter), by mapping sensors to sound synthesis in audio programming environment SuperCollider.

No single instance of these methods, either in the form of orthographic projections or perspectival representation, can address all questions regarding the design, but as a whole, they demonstrate a comprehensive range of information about the building or object they intend to represent. This explicates an inevitable degree of deficiency in representation, regardless of its type. In addition, perspective-based optical illusions manipulate our spatial perception by deliberately misrepresenting the reality. In this regard, they are not new concepts to architectural representation. As a consequence, Optically Illusive Architecture (OIA) is proposed, not as a solution to fill the gap between the representing and represented spaces, but as a design paradigm whose concept derives from and accounts for this gap. By OIA we aim to cast light to an undeniable role of viewpoints in designing architectural spaces. The idea is to establish a methodology in a way that the deficiency of current representational techniques—manifested as specific thread of optical illusions—flourishes into thoughtful results embodied as actual architectural spaces. Within our design paradigm, we define a framework to be able to effectively analyze its precedents, generate new space, and evaluate their efficiencies. Moreover, the framework raises a hierarchical set of questions to differentiate OIA from a visual gimmick. Furthermore, we study two OIA-driven environments, by conducting empirical studies using Virtual Reality (VR). These studies bear essential information, in terms of design performance, and the public’s ability to engage and interact with an OIA space, prior to the actual fabrication of the structures.","dir":"content/output/publications","base":"ijac-2021-hosseini.json","ext":".json","sourceBase":"ijac-2021-hosseini.yaml","sourceExt":".yaml","labs":["curio"]}')},9755:e=>{"use strict";e.exports=JSON.parse('{"date":"2022-10","title":"Prototyping Soft Devices with Interactive Bioplastics","authors":["Marion Koelle","Madalina Nicolae","Aditya Shekhar Nittala","Marc Teyssier","J\xfcrgen Steimle"],"series":"UIST 2022","doi":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3526113.3545623","keywords":"bioplastics, biomaterials, do-it-yourself, DIY, sustainability","award":"Best Paper","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Paq3P3EsKQ","pages":16,"abstract":"Designers and makers are increasingly interested in leveraging bio-based and bio-degradable ‘do-it-yourself’ (DIY) materials for sustainable prototyping.

By overlaying the remote instructor\'s virtual hands in the local user\'s MR view, the remote instructor can guide and control the local user as if they were physically present.
