Factors such as healthcare providers&#x27; limited time, inefficient clinical environments, and patients&#x27; difficulties in communicating their concerns can be the causes of this miscommunication. In this thesis, I explore the design of visualizations to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients during clinical visits. In the first part (i) of this thesis, I present the results of a literature review I have conducted to expand our understanding of patients&#x27; and providers&#x27; communication challenges during in-clinic visits. In the second phase (ii) I discuss the results of interviews with healthcare providers and I contrast and compare patients&#x27; and providers&#x27; perspectives in the context of each other to unveil the roots of their communication challenges. Among the communication challenges we identified, I focus on exploring the challenges and the realities patients and healthcare providers face tracking and sharing patient-generated health data. In the third part of this dissertation (iii), I discuss the results of a series of interviews and focus groups with patients and healthcare providers I have conducted to gain a better understanding of patient-generated data communication challenges. I leverage this understanding to propose potential visualization designs representing patient-generated data collections to improve the process of reviewing and communicating these data between patients and healthcare providers. In the fourth part of this dissertation (iv), I discuss the results of the interviews with healthcare providers seeking their reflection on the proposed visualization designs. Finally, in collaboration with our healthcare provider team in Alberta Healthcare Services, I implement the prototypes of a number of carefully selected visualization designs.
